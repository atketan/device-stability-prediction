# Device Stability Prediction
Prediction of positional stability for a Gyroscope incorporated device using Machine Learning. Given a gyroscopic data, machine learning model is expected to predict whether the device is stable or moving.

## Technical objective
[x] Prediction of a stability of a gyroscope incorporated device.
[ ] Calculation of orientation angle of the device under noisy conditons using machine learning.
[ ] Calculation of orientation angle of the device with Kalman or complimentary filter & machine learning.

## Learning objective
This project has following objectives and each objective will be treated as a milestone.
[x] IoT perspective: Understand the nuances in data collection.
[x] Machine learning perspective: Start from basic machine learning algorithm for prediction.
